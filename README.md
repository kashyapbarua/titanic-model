# Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster

### Why this problem?
The reason why I picked this project up is that it is one of the best datasets out there in the market for folks who wants to start off building ML 
models and also get their hand dirty on Feature Engineering. The dataset is a popular type available for beginners on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

### What are the contents of the repository?
[Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/kashyapbarua/titanic-model/blob/main/titanic-feature-engg.ipynb)

### What are the packages used in this project?

`numpy`
`pandas`
`seaborn`
`matplotlib.pyplot`

### Model Scores and Kaggle Leaderboard

Current position in the leaderboard is at 10560 with a score of 78.23%. Working on other techniques to improve this score further
